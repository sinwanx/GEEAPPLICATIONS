Explore Vegetation Indices

An interactive Streamlit + Google Earth Engine (GEE) web application to analyze vegetation dynamics and detect deforestation. Users can upload their own shapefiles, calculate vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI) across a time range (2015–2024), visualize maps, generate temporal charts, and download results as GeoTIFF.
